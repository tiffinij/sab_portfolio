                <h2>A Summary of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</h2>
                <p>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
                    Hirohiko Araki. It was originally serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump
                    magazine from 1987 to 2004, and was transferred to the monthly seinen magazine
                     Ultra Jump in 2005. The series is divided into eight story arcs, each following
                     a new protagonist bearing the "JoJo" nickname. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is
                     arguably his best and most notable work. </p>

                                him and plans to usurp him as heir to the Joestar
                                family. When Dio's attempts are thwarted, he transforms
                                himself into a vampire with the use of an ancient Stone Mask
                                and destroys the Joestar estate. Jonathan embarks on a journey,
                                meets new allies and masters the Hamon (波紋, "Ripple") martial

                                 is salvaged from the ocean. Because DIO had managed to capture Jonathan's
