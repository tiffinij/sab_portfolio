                        <h3>Java Full Stack Development</h3>
                        <p>
                          I have been designing and programming Java programs since 2019. Through The Software Guild's
                          certification program I have received formal training in Full Stack Web Development. I have completed
                          several projects that implement front and back-end design. I have also learned to incorporate
                          mySQL databases into my Java projects for data peresistence and management. My Java work included
                          servlets, Java-based APIs and REST applications.
                          I have several projects displayed in my work section below.

                        <h3>Python</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am working to build my proficiency in other languages. I have quickly picked up Python
                            and I am currently building a library of small demo Python projects to display my proficiency
                            to employers. My hope is to gain a level of understanding in Python that is equivalent or better
                            than my understanding of Java.

                        <p>
                          I am a graduate of the Java certification program at The Software Guild. I have found my passion
                          in programming and web development, and I am greatly looking forward to pursuing a career in software
                          and programming. My current experience is in Full Stack Web development in Java, and I am also pursuing
                          further education in .NET/C# and Python. I enjoy designing and building programs on my own, but I
                          also really enjoy coding as a part of a collaborative effort as it illuminates the multitude of ways
                          there are to approach a problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I have also obtained both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in the environmental sciences and energy and
                          environmental policy. During both degrees, I have had opportunities to informally immerse myself in
                          information technology and programming. I have served as program and web coordinator for the Center for Integrated
                          Biological and Environmental Research at Delaware State university, and I have become very passionate
                          about web development and the systems that I use to do my day-to-day work. My recent Java certification allowed me to exercise
                          these skills and prove to myself that I am capable of working in this field. I have also continued
                          practicing in .NET/C# and python. I greatly enjoyed my work in mySQL. Lastly, working as a coordinator for
                          a four-year university the last five years has prepared me to deal with management tasks such as processing employment and payroll
                          paperwork, managing contact with vendors, meeting planning and development, personnel management. Also,
                          working in a college environment has prepared me to quickly adapt to changes in policy and also be responsive
                          to the needs of the faculty, staff, and students, and work well in a team or solo environment.
